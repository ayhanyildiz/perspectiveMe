# perspectiveMe
turn any element into perspective view with resizing window. This is written in pure JS, no dependency to any javascript libraries.

Simply by adding class name `perspectiveMe`  can turn your element into perspective view. Perspective angle is bound to page width, lower width gets deeper perspective. Enjoy!
